*The background of the terminals does not come with the theme*

Dark-My-Posh is compatible with PowerShell (1.0 or more), CMD, and Bash terminals and can further be edited to read for other terminals on your system.

The following symbol shows if your terminal is in administrator [ ⛯ ].

The diamond shows the status of your last commands exit code (*Successful or failure, see images belown*):

If the command failed the diamond will go red, if successful it will stay magenta.

Dark-My-Posh also supports command run time, shows how long a command took to run.

It also gives simple Git info if your CWD is a repository:
- `main⇡` if you are ahead of your branch.
- `⇣main` if you are behind your branch.
- `*main` if you have unstagged changes.
- `main*` if you have stagged changes.
- `┎main` if you are detached from your branch.
- `main` if nothing is detected between repo and CWD.

It is recommended you use the `SauceCodePro Nerd Font` however any nerdfont should work fine with this theme.
